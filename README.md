# Bharat-Intern-Task1-Iris-Classification
This is an ML model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
The Iris Classification Machine Learning model is designed to accurately identify and classify iris flowers into three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Utilizing a dataset containing iris flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), the model employs algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to learn patterns and relationships within the data. 

Tech Stack: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
